Hi Team,

As discussed, below is a detailed breakdown of the Terraform modules we need to create for AWS Redshift, Data Zone, and Athena. I‚Äôve also listed the exact inputs (details/format) we will require from the architecture team before starting implementation.

1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Redshift Module

Purpose: Deploy a secure, production-ready Redshift cluster.
Inputs Required:

Cluster Basics:

cluster_identifier (name of the cluster)

node_type (e.g., ra3.4xlarge, dc2.large)

number_of_nodes (single-node or multi-node)

database_name (default DB)

master_username (stored securely in Secrets Manager/SSM)

Networking:

VPC ID

Subnet IDs (for subnet group)

Security Group IDs (firewall rules)

Publicly accessible? (Yes/No)

Security:

KMS Key ARN (for encryption at rest)

IAM Role for S3 access (to support COPY/UNLOAD)

Enhanced VPC Routing (enabled/disabled)

Monitoring/Logging:

Audit log S3 bucket

CloudWatch alarms configuration

2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Data Zone Module

Purpose: Build governed data lake environment with storage, governance, and security.
Inputs Required:

Environment Setup:

Domain name (Data Zone domain/project name)

Projects (Dev, QA, Prod separation)

Account IDs for environment setup

Data Lake Storage:

S3 bucket names (Raw, Curated, Analytics, Audit)

Lifecycle rules (retention, archival policy)

KMS Key ARN for encryption

IAM & Governance:

Who can publish datasets (producer roles)

Who can consume datasets (reader roles)

Governance policies to apply (Lake Formation permissions)

Integration:

Will Data Zone integrate with Redshift and Athena? (Yes/No)

Execution role for governance

3Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Athena Module

Purpose: Provide serverless query capability over data lake.
Inputs Required:

Workgroup Setup:

Workgroup name (e.g., analytics-wg)

Result output location (S3 path)

Encryption type (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

Databases & Tables:

Database names (e.g., sales_db, logs_db)

Table schemas (defined via Glue catalog)

Security:

IAM roles/groups allowed to query/run jobs

Tags for cost allocation

Monitoring:

CloudWatch metrics/alerts configuration

4Ô∏è‚É£ DevOps/IaC Side (Supporting Modules)

S3 Buckets ‚Äì Inputs: name, versioning, encryption, lifecycle rules.

Secrets Manager ‚Äì Inputs: secret names, rotation policy.

KMS/ACM ‚Äì Inputs: key alias, cert domain names.

Encryption Setup ‚Äì Which services require CMKs.

Certificates ‚Äì DNS validation or import details.

üìå Next Steps

Collect inputs (cluster details, bucket names, IAM groups, policies) from architects & client.

Define these inputs in terraform.tfvars for each environment (Dev, QA, Prod).

Build reusable Terraform modules:

modules/redshift_cluster

modules/data_zone

modules/athena

Deploy in non-prod first for validation (POC).

Extend to production after successful validation.

‚úÖ Why This Approach

Keeps infra as code, reusable across accounts/environments.

Enforces security best practices (encryption, IAM least-privilege, logging).

Ensures audit readiness (HIPAA/ISO compliance).

Makes deployments repeatable, consistent, and automated.

Please review these input requirements and share the values for Dev/QA/Prod so we can proceed with the Terraform module creation.
