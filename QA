Redshift (extra)
	â€¢	Do we require private-only access via DX/VPN/PrivateLink?
	â€¢	Enable Enhanced VPC Routing?
	â€¢	WLM queues & concurrency targets?
	â€¢	Snapshot copy: target region + KMS key?
	â€¢	Data sharing between clusters/namespaces?

Athena (extra)
	â€¢	Enforce workgroup-only usage?
	â€¢	Preferred file format (Parquet/Iceberg)?
	â€¢	Partition rules and who manages them?
	â€¢	Per-workgroup query spend limit?

DataZone / Lake Formation
	â€¢	Exact producer/consumer roles and approval workflow?
	â€¢	LF permission model (db/table/column masking)?
	â€¢	Metadata/glossary ownership?

Security/Compliance
	â€¢	Tagging standard (Owner, CostCenter, DataClassification).
	â€¢	PHI detection via Macieâ€”scope & cadence?
	â€¢	Log retention per type; S3 Object Lock compliance mode on audit buckets?
	â€¢	Region allowlist via SCPs?

Networking
	â€¢	Final subnet list (3 AZs), NAT strategy, DNS (Route 53).
	â€¢	VPC endpoints list confirmation (S3, KMS, STS, Glue, SSM, CW, Secrets).
	â€¢	Egress controls (no internet path?)â€”use centralized egress?

DR/Ops
	â€¢	RTO/RPO targets; quarterly restore tests needed?
	â€¢	Pager/Teams alerting for Admin/Break-glass role assumption?
	â€¢	Monthly access review cadence?

Cost
	â€¢	Non-prod scale smaller? Use Redshift Serverless for Dev/Test?
	â€¢	Budgets & alerts by env.

==============================================================================

As discussed, here are the inputs required to proceed with Terraform modules for Redshift, DataZone, Athena, and supporting IaC services. Could you please confirm/provide values for each?

ðŸ”¹ Redshift

Cluster type: Provisioned or Serverless?

Node type/count (if provisioned) / RPU (if serverless)

VPC, subnet IDs, security groups

KMS Key ARN (for encryption)

Snapshot policy (frequency, retention, cross-region copy)

IAM roles for Admin/Analyst/Audit

ðŸ”¹ DataZone

Number of environments (Dev/Test/Prod)

Data domains (e.g., Clinical, Finance, Ops)

Primary sources (S3, Redshift)

IAM roles for Producers/Consumers

Approval workflow for dataset access

Data classification tags

ðŸ”¹ Athena

Workgroup names per environment

Result S3 bucket/prefix & encryption key

Glue catalog details (schemas, tables)

Data format (CSV/Parquet/ORC/Iceberg)

IAM roles & access levels

Query cost control policies

ðŸ”¹ DevOps/IaC Services

S3 buckets (names, lifecycle rules, encryption type)

Secrets Manager (list of secrets, rotation policy)

ACM Certificates (domains, scope)

KMS Key structure (per env/service or shared)

CloudTrail/CloudWatch (log retention, org-level or account-wise)

Mandatory tags (Owner, Project, DataClassification, CostCenter)

This will help us finalize module variables and proceed with implementation
