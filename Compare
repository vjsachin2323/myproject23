Input
Why Needed
Risk if Missing
Redshift
Cluster Type (Provisioned/Serverless)
Impacts cost & performance based on workload
Overpaying for small workloads OR underperforming for big workloads
VPC, Subnet IDs, Security Groups
Ensures cluster runs in private network
Cluster may get public endpoint → security violation
KMS Key ARN
Required for HIPAA encryption at rest
Non-compliance if default AWS key used
Snapshot/Backup Policy
Disaster Recovery & audit recovery
Data loss, failed recovery during audit
DataZone
Environments (Dev/Test/Prod)
Governance separation
Dev/Test may access Prod data → compliance breach
Producer/Consumer Roles
Control who publishes/consumes data
Anyone can share datasets → no governance
Data Classification (PHI/PII)
Compliance tagging for HIPAA/ISO
PHI may not be tagged → fines/violations
Athena
Workgroups
Isolate queries & enforce budgets
Queries may overrun cost, no segregation
Result Location (S3 + Encryption)
Secure storage of query results
Results stored unencrypted → compliance fail
Data Format (Parquet/CSV)
Impacts performance & cost
Running on CSV = 10x more expensive
DevOps/IaC
S3 Buckets (names + lifecycle)
Naming convention + retention compliance
Duplicate/unmanaged buckets, high costs
Secrets Manager
Secure DB/API creds with rotation
Hardcoded creds → major security risk
ACM / KMS
TLS + encryption for apps/data
Self-signed certs, weak encryption
CloudTrail / Config Logs
Audit/compliance evidence (7+ yrs)
Fail HIPAA audit → penalties
